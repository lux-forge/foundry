  - change: "Added token authentication for PyPI"
    notes: >
      Introduced support for secure publishing using a PyPI token stored in `.secrets/pypi.token`.
      Credentials are now read dynamically during the publish step to avoid hardcoding.
  - change: "Automated PyPI push workflow"
    notes: >
      Integrated `twine upload` into the PublishMenu with token-based authentication.
      Enables one-click publishing from the CLI with version sync and build validation.
