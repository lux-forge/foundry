changes:
  - change: "Unified key interpretation across platforms"
    notes: >
      Patched `__get_unix_key()` to call `interpret()` internally, ensuring consistent key normalization across Windows and Unix-like systems.
      Arrow keys and control sequences now return standardized values (e.g. 'UP', 'ENTER'), enabling clean menu validation and suppressing logic breaks.
  - change: "Updated Python interpreter path in VSCode settings"
    notes: >
      Changed the default Python interpreter path in `.vscode/settings.json` to point to Python 3.14 within the virtual environment.
  - change: "Refined import statement in users.py"
    notes: >
      Corrected the import statement in `docker/users/users.py` to properly import the `Menu` class from the `foundry` package.
  - change: "Removed redundant key interpretation logging"
    notes: >
      Eliminated duplicate logging of interpreted keys in `keyhandler.py` to streamline debug output and improve performance.
  - change: "Cleaned up version.py changelog"
    notes: >
      Removed outdated changelog entries from `foundry/version.py` to maintain clarity and relevance in version tracking.
